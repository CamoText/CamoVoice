## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Why use private speech-to-text?
A: Protects sensitive information by avoiding text entry logs, preventing third-party telemetry, and keeping voice biometric data local. Ideal for legal, medical, personal, or AI prompt use cases.

Q: How fast is transcription?
A: Fast mode provides near-instant results. Thinking mode is slower but more accurate. First transcription of each session takes longer as model loads; subsequent transcriptions are faster.

Q: What configuration is needed?
A: None. Works immediately with system default microphone. Optional: select specific input device, choose playback voice, adjust text size. Settings auto-save.

Q: How does it work technically?
A: Uses faster-whisper (CTranslate2 Whisper implementation) with bundled models. All processing runs locally on CPU with int8 quantization. No internet or API calls.
